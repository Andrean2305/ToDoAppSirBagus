Hello Sir Bagus, this is my to do app using React. 

what things that can be highlighted from the project?

1.I can add and update the title of the todo and also the description

2.I add the time, so it will take excact currently time

3.You can filter by clicking one of the 3 button. If you want to see all check the choose all button, if want to see completed choose done button, and if want to see incompleted choose undone buttton

4.You can click check button to state the assignment is finished

5.edit button for edit

6.trash button to throw away

7.also I add number button. 

The downside of my code:

I did not finish the due date part (not required but i was thinking on making it)

I also add the image of my firebase
